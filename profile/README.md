# GlucoseDAO

**Innovative decentralized science project focused on glucose prediction and health optimization, combining technology with community-driven healthcare solutions.**

The project aims to develop an open-source glucose prediction system while building a collaborative community focused on health and longevity. 
Built on existing language models, working towards integrating RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), hybrid search, and AI agent workflows. Developed using open-source libraries from [Longevity Genie](https://github.com/longevity-genie) and [Glucobench](https://github.com/IrinaStatsLab/GlucoBench) Also transformer model used is from [Gluformer repo](https://github.com/mrsergazinov/gluformer)

## Key Features

- **Glucose based repositories:** All content is oriented to this particular approach, be it prediction model, sorting and processing data or presenting
- **Hybrid Search Capabilities:** Combines traditional search methods with advanced semantic search techniques.
- **AI Agent Workflows:** Utilizes orchestration logic to streamline interactions between LLMs and external tools.
